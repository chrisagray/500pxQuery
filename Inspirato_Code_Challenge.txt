Inspirato Code Challenge

Build an image search UI using a public API.  We recommend using the 500px API, however feel free to use any others!

Requirements

- It should be a universal app written in Swift, it should work on both iPhone and iPad.
- The app should be able to search via keyword.
- The app should be able to scroll through the search results.
- The app should display each search result with an image and it's title, in a grid format.
- The app should be able to select a cell, and show some additional information about the search result.
- When the app gets to the bottom of the results, it should be able to load more at the bottom, "infinite scrolling."
- The app should be able to work with any screen size and orientation.
- If you want to show us something more, feel free to go nuts! However, don't let it distract you from the main assignment.

We don't mind if you use 3rd party libraries to help implement anything, however they shouldn't solve the main problem!  We want this app to show off your coding skills.

We estimate that this app will take about 4-5 hours.  If you think it'll take longer for any reason, please let us know!  You can send us your code any way you'd like.  Github, dropbox, zip via e-mail, etc.
